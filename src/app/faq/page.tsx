    "Frequently asked questions about ByteFlow AI Labs' automation services, how we work, and what to expect.",
};

const faqs = [
  {
    q: "What does ByteFlow AI Labs actually do?",
    a: "We design, build, and deploy AI automation systems for businesses. This includes workflow automation (connecting apps and eliminating manual steps), AI-powered chatbots, custom data pipelines, and integrations between your existing tools and modern AI models.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who is a typical ByteFlow client?",
    a: "Small-to-medium businesses and startups that have identified repetitive processes costing them time or money. Common examples: teams manually moving data between tools, businesses answering the same customer questions repeatedly, or companies that want AI-powered insights from their existing data.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to be technical to work with you?",
    a: "No. We handle all the technical implementation. You describe the problem or outcome you want — we translate that into an automation system. We communicate in plain language throughout the engagement.",
  },
  {
    q: "What tools and platforms do you work with?",
    a: "We work across a broad stack: n8n, Make, Zapier for workflow automation; OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini for AI models; PostgreSQL, Supabase, Airtable for data; and custom Next.js / Python systems when off-the-shelf tools aren't the right fit.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does a typical project take?",
    a: "A focused automation (one workflow, one integration) typically takes 1–2 weeks from scoping to deployment. A full AI system with multiple workflows, a custom chatbot, and a data pipeline typically runs 4–8 weeks. We'll give you a realistic timeline during the scoping call.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you price your services?",
    a: "We price per project based on scope, not by the hour. You'll receive a fixed quote after an initial scoping call so there are no billing surprises. Ongoing maintenance retainers are available for clients who want continuous support.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens after the automation is built?",
    a: "We document everything, walk your team through how it works, and hand over full ownership. If you'd like ongoing support — monitoring, updates, adding new steps — we offer monthly retainer packages.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will an automation break if a connected app changes its API?",
    a: "APIs do occasionally change. For clients on a maintenance retainer we monitor for breakage and fix issues proactively. For one-time project clients we provide a 30-day post-launch support window and can quote for longer-term coverage.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you integrate with tools we've already built internally?",
    a: "Yes. If your internal tool has a REST API, webhook support, or a database we can read from, we can integrate it. We've connected custom CRMs, internal dashboards, and proprietary databases into automation workflows.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I get started?",
    a: "Send us a message on our Contact page describing the process you want to automate. We'll reply within one business day to schedule a free 30-minute scoping call. No commitment required.",
  },
