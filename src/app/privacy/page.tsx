          <Section title="2. Information We Collect">
            <p>
              We collect personal information only when you actively provide it to us. Depending on

            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 pl-2">
              <li>

              <li>
                <strong className="text-brand-text">Phone number</strong> — for follow-up calls or messages
